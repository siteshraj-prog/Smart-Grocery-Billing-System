1. Project Title

Smart Grocery Billing System

2. Objective

The objective of this project is to design and develop a simple and efficient billing system that allows users to select grocery items, specify quantities, and automatically generate a total bill. The system simulates a real-world grocery checkout process using fundamental Python programming concepts.

3. Project Description

The Smart Grocery Billing System is a menu-driven Python application that maintains a predefined list of grocery items and their prices.
The user can:

View available items

Select items to purchase

Enter quantity for each item

View calculated item-wise cost

Generate a final bill

Save the bill as a text file for future reference

The system is fully console-based and uses functions, dictionaries, loops, and file handling to achieve modularity and clarity.

 4. Scope of the Project

The project is designed for academic learning and practical exposure to:

Input handling

Data processing

File operations

Modular programming

Real-world billing simulations

Error handling (invalid inputs, wrong items, etc.)

It is suitable for subjects such as:

Introduction to Problem Solving & Programming

Python Programming

5.Workflow

Display available grocery items

Allow user to choose items

Ask for quantity

Calculate cost = price × quantity

Store purchased items in a dictionary

Continue until the user enters done

Display the final bill

Save the bill as a .txt file

Exit the system

6. Technologies Used

Dictionaries

Control statements

Functions

File Handling

String formatting

7. Key Features

Simple console-based user interface

Predefined grocery item list

Automatic price calculation

Clear billing summary

Bill saved to text file using UTF-8 encoding

Beginner-friendly design



8.conclusion

The Smart Grocery Billing System demonstrates the application of fundamental programming principles in solving a real-world problem. It reinforces the concepts of modular design, data manipulation, and structured implementation, making it an excellent introductory-level academic project.
